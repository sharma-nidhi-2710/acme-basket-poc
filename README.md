# acme-basket-poc

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a shopping basket for **Acme Widget Co**, built in **Ruby** with **RSpec**.  
It demonstrates clean object-oriented design, separation of concerns, and extensibility for future offers and delivery rules.  

---

## Features  
- Add widgets to a basket using product codes.  
- Apply delivery charges based on basket total.  
- Support for offers (e.g. *Buy one Red Widget, get the second half price*).  
- Easily extendable with new products, offers, and delivery rules.  
- Fully tested with **RSpec**.
